    about: "Cloud chambers are particle detectors, sensitive to the movement of charged particles through a vapor. Cloud chambers can be built with easily-accessible materials, and provide a view of subatomic particle like muons, created by collisions of particles in our atmosphere, and alpha particles, which are produced in some nuclear reactions.<br /><br />Our goal was to (1) build a simple cloud chamber using materials that are readily available, and (2) capture images/movies of particles detected in our cloud chamber that could then be analyzed using software to create visualizations showing the trajectories of sub-atomic particles.<br /><br />We succeeded in building a cloud chamber using iso-propyl alcohol as a medium, and dry ice as a way to supersaturate the alcohol. We saw both tracks from cosmic muons, as well as tracks from the decay of a radioactive source extracted from a smoke detector. We took several movies of the decays, but we had difficulty in capturing still images of the decays. We think there are promising avenues for turning this working detector into a broader tool for scientific inquiry, and look forward to continuing this project."
