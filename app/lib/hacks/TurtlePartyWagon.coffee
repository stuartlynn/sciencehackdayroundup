    about: "A lot of us have fond memories of LOGO.  LOGO was a simple programming language that controlled a drawing turtle.  It was great for kids due to its simplicity and instant feedback.  Lego LOGO was a version that included physical parts and eventually evolved into Lego Mindstorms.  However, Lego Mindstorms is not exactly easy to use.  Even as an adult, the user interface and block diagrams is often times counter-intuitive. <br /><br />We wanted to bring the simplicity of LOGO back.  But with real live cars.  And a web interface.   And KITTENS.  OK, just kidding about the kittens."
