  about: "Original concept was to create a 'Data Explorer' for Chicago City Data.<br />We created an alpha based on this premise that grabbed chicago datasets and visualized them with the d3 library.  This morning we realized the municipal tools for this task were actually rather good, and we were hard pressed to offer many features/benefits over that.<br /><br />We reevaluated and pivoted to utilize the datasets we had wired up, and added the Twitter API to allow people to interact and find data by tweeting."
