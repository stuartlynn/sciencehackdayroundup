    about: "A web app that calculates how far you've traveled in space and time based on your flight data from TripIt or Dopplr. The site calculates 1) what percentage you've traveled to the Moon based on the distance you've traveled around the Earth and 2) how many nanoseconds into the future you've traveled due to time dilation (your time slows down relative to those stationary on Earth and thus you are able to travel into the future). Calculations based on all of your available flight data, using gravitational and lorentz time dilation and the average distance to the Moon from the Earth."
