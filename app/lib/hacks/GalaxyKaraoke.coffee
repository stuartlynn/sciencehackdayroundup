    about: "We made a planetarium into a karaoke machine / audio-visual extravaganza!<br /><br />A while ago a bunch of awesome Galaxy Zoo forum members collected a complete set of real galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which just happen to look like letters of the alphabet, numbers, and punctuation.<br /><br />We resurrected some previously hacked together code which takes these images and pastes them together into arbitrary words and sentences (yes I know it's like a font, but we didn't make a font).  We then used this to generate lyrics to David Bowie's 'Space Oddity', put these images into a 3D model of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and choreographed a fly past the lyrics in time with the song!<br /><br />We also attempted to make the process as automated as possible, i.e. parsing karaoke file formats for lyrics and time stamps, but the final hack required a manual step to time the fly through to the song.<br />"
