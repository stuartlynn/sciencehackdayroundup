  about: "It attempts to balance a payload attached to a AirRamp kite, by tilting an internal load based on the tilt measured by an accelerometer connected to an arduino which controls the mechanism by driving a servomotor.<br /><br />This allows the payload to descent safely after a High Altitude Balloon bursts, the kite is supposed to be steered to control the landing point so it is a desired one, the hardware for this was not implemented but some of the software was also embedded in the arduino.<br /><br />To determine the safe sites, the designers of the team made a new UI for the predictor in:<br /><br />http://habhub.org/predict/"
