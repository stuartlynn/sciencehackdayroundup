    about: "The site allows users to upload their data from OpenPaths  - or use an example - to explore how they travel, how fast they travel, and where they go. Some basic stats are provided on the current version of the site.<br /><br />The idea is that this app is a basis for exploring your own personal geographical stats. It could eventually be compared with other city-based geospatial data sets to tell you things such as where/when there may be a better route home or to let you know that you pass by interesting places and events in your daily life."
