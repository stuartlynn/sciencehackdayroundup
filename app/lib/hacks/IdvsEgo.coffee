    about: "For Science Hack Day Chicago, my colleague Sean Massa and I decided to put together a game using a couple of different devices that we found interesting for input.<br /><br />First of all, we used the NeuroSky MindWave portable EEG brainwave headset.  This device senses the user's brainwaves and provides an interface to access data from the device.  We used this information to control how the levels of the game itself are generated.  The more calm and focused the player is, the easier the level becomes.  This leads to some interesting moments when the player panics because the level is too difficult causing the level to become even more difficult.<br /><br />Next, we took the motion sensor output from an Apple iPad to control the character in our game.  This made for a more intuitive experience when playing the game and makes the game more physical, which has some effect on the mental state of the player.<br /><br />The game itself is a rather simple one.  The player must avoid rising platforms as they scroll toward the top of the screen.  The speed at which the platforms rise is controlled by the player's level of calmness while the size of the 'holes' between the platforms is controlled by the player's level of focus.  The player uses the iPad to move the onscreen character back and forth."
