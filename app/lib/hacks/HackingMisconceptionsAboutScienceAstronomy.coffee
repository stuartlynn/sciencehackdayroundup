    about: "The Night the Stars Went to Sleep is a children’s book that turns familiar night sky objects and events into a cast of amiable characters that find themselves in a world of endless light after Darkness disappears. He’s been tricked into believing that he is feared and unwanted, but without the spreading of his velvet cloak the sky will stay bright and we won’t see the stars. The stars all agree that he has to be found and convinced to return. The bravest constellations head out on a quest to find and bring Darkness back. Their journey leads them down a path of universal wonder and helps explain natural occurrences and facts while<br />dispelling some common science misconceptions that include when we can see stars, if the moon really gives off light, and explores the relationship between Darkness and the Sun."
