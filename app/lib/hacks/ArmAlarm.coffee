    about: "ArmAlarm will wake you up in a completely new way. Studies show that feeling awake is positively correlated with being physically active. Instead of annoying sounds, ArmAlarm is a wearable alarm that wakes you gently with vibrating pulses on your wrist. The alarm begins pulsing at your set time, and stops only when the built-in pulse reader determines that you are awake and active. With ArmAlarm, there is no snooze button. It won't turn off until your heart rate is up. <br /><br />At Science Hack Day Chicago, we combined an Arduino board with a salvaged cell phone haptic motor and IR transmitter and receiver bulbs as a pulse-detecting mechanism. We were able to use IR signals to detect pulse rate when held against the skin, and the vibrating alarm is fully functional.<br />"
