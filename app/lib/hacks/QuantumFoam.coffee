    about: "Quantum field theory is the marriage of quantum mechanics and special relativity and predicts that particles are spontaneously popping in and out of the vacuum. When energy is put into the vacuum, as in particle colliders, these particles can become 'real'. This hack is a very naive visualization of this process, where the user puts energy into the vacuum through the mic on the computer. "
